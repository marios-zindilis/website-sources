Pizza Maker
-----------

The Pizza Maker is a little proof-of-concept web application I built to learn
how to tie together Angular5, Bootstrap, Django and the Django Rest Framework.
[Fork on GitHub][8].

MusicBrainz Django Models
-------------------------

This project is an attempt to express the MusicBrainz Server database schema
as Django Models. [Read the Documentation][1] or [Fork on GitHub][2].

Zalza
-----

I wrote this script and used to use it to generate the content of my website,
before I switched to Jekyll. It traverses a directory of sources, mostly
written in Markdown, and produces static HTML files. It was triggered by a
`post-merge` Git hook on the web server. [Fork on GitHub][3].

BackupPC Archive Script
-----------------------

This is a script that can create archives of backups taken with [BackupPC][4]. 
It can be used to keep an offsite copy of the latest backup of a host. 
[Fork on GitHub][5].

Briki WP Registration Whitelist
-------------------------------

This is a WordPress plugin that I wrote in April of 2011, that matches a new
user's email against a whitelist during the user registration process. It was a
request in the Greek WordPress Users' Forum (then wordpress.gr, now gone).
[Fork on GitHub][6].

Grokking Tech
-------------

From June 2016 to June 2017 I ran a website at http://grokking.tech/ in which
I collected video recordings from talks at technology-related conferences.
That is now defunct as I did not put enough time into it to make it work. The
static website is archived at [Projects / Grokking Tech][7].
