Random tips for BackupPC:

1.  On your client systems (those that will be backed up by BackupPC), rotate 
    your logs (whether compressed or not) with dates in the filenames, instead 
    of appending prefixes such as `.1`, `.2`, `.3`, etc. The benefit from this 
    is that BackupPC will ignore old logs on new runs, since they will have the 
    same name and the same checksum. If you rotate logs with numbered names, 
    BackupPC will transfer them again, since the name will have changed. This 
    configuration is achieved with the `dateext` parameter set in `logrotate` 
    configuration file, which on CentOS 6 is at `/etc/logrotate.conf`, by 
    default.

2.  If `mlocate` is installed on the BackupPC system, you should exclude the 
    backup directory from being indexed by the nightly run of `updatedb`, 
    otherwise `/var/lib/mlocate/mlocate.db` will become enormous. To exclude 
    the backup directory, edit `/etc/updatedb.conf` and append the directory 
    path to the end of the line for the `PRUNEPATHS` variable.
