Apple, give something back, you bitch.</li>

<h3>Networking related:</h3>
<ul><li><a href="http://blog.internetgovernance.org/blog/_archives/2011/3/23/4778509.html">Microsoft wants to buy 666,624 IPv4 from the bankrupt Nortel</a>. The crowd at Slashdot <a href="http://slashdot.org/firehose.pl?op=view&type=story&sid=11/03/24/2047258">suggests that IPv4s will start selling in higher prices, like any scarce commodity</a>, which is a bit scary.</li>
<li>Now that they have one less thing to worry about (distributing the shares of the IPv4 pie), <abbr title="Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers">ICANN</abbr> can <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0311/51161.html">dispute over whether or not the U.S. Gov't is their daddy</a>, not long after the US <abbr title="Department of Homeland Security">DHS</abbr> swiftly seized a bunch of some 100 domains without sound proof that the owners were doing something wrong. A few clicks later, I found myself resolving <a href="http://www.opennicproject.org/">.free and .oss domains against OpenNIC</a>.</li>

### Misc geek reading ###

*   [Microsoft disabled https access to Hotmail][1] for several countries that already have intense government-side net
    monitoring but then put it back and said it's a bug, not a feature.
*   Not exactly reading, but still quite cool, [installing and testing all versions of IE, from 1 to 9][2]. Also some
    Wireshark digging into each one.
