Django works well as the back-end of an application that uses Angular5 in the front-end. In my attempt to learn
Angular5 well enough to build a small proof-of-concept application, I couldn't find a simple working example of a
combination of the two frameworks, so I created one. I called this the Pizza Maker. It's [available on GitHub][1], and
its documentation is in the `README`.

If you have any feedback for this, please open an issue on GitHub.
