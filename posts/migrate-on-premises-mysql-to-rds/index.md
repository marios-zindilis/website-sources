I miss having the free time to attend Percona Webinars. They are really good. 

This is a recording from a webinar presented by a Technical Account Manager at 
Percona, regarding experiences gained from the migration of a sizeable MySQL 
installation from onsite to AWS RDS. It's packed with valuable technical 
information, as are Percona webinars, typically.
